List of steps to setup demo code
================================

1) Start a windows or linux command line console and create your working directory (note, that I used a windows OS)

2) Pull the code to your local machine working directory or Colab from Github:
   => git clone https://github.com/aidowu1/Hands-on-Intro-to-building-Explainability-for-RecSys.git

3) Change directory to root location of the code:
   => cd Hands-on-Intro-to-building-Explainability-for-RecSys

4) Create a conda virtual environment:
   => conda create -n pydata2023_recsys python=3.7
   
5) Activate the virtual environment:
   => conda activate pydata2023_recsys
   
6) Install the dependencies for Recoxplainer via PIP:
   => pip install -r requirements.txt
   
7) Install dependencies for LIME and MyFM:
   => pip install myfm lime
   
8) Install pandas profilling tool for EDA:
   pip install pandas-profiling
   
9) Register your created conda virtual environment i.e. 'pydata2023_recsys' as jupyer noebook kernel:
   => python -m ipykernel install --user --name=pydata2023_recsys
   
10) Spin up a jupyer notebook instance:
    => jupyter notebook
   
11) Navigate to the folder location of the demo noebooks and select your desired demo:
    => <YOUR WORKING DIRECTORY>\Hands-on-Intro-to-building-Explainability-for-RecSys\ExplainableRecsys\Code\Demos\Notebooks
	
12) For each notebook set the kernel to: "pydata2023_recsys"
